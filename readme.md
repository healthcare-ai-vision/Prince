# 📘 Week 2 Work: Image Processing & Medical Imaging Dataset Exploration

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this week’s work is to:
1. Understand basic **image processing techniques** using Python.
2. Explore and critically analyze **real-world medical imaging datasets** used in machine learning and healthcare applications.

---

## 🧪 Part 1: Image Processing in Python

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- **OpenCV (cv2)** – Image loading, resizing, edge detection, filtering
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations on image matrices
- **Matplotlib** – Image and histogram visualization
- **scikit-image** – Noise generation utilities

---

### 🖼️ Image Processing Steps Performed

#### 1. Image Loading
Two images were loaded using OpenCV and converted from **BGR to RGB** format for correct visualization.

#### 2. Grayscale Conversion
- RGB images were converted to grayscale.
- Grayscale images reduce computational complexity and are commonly used in medical imaging.

#### 3. Histogram Visualization
- Pixel intensity histograms were plotted.
- Histograms help analyze contrast, brightness, and intensity distribution.

#### 4. Image Resizing
- Images were resized to a fixed resolution (256 × 256).
- Resizing ensures consistent input dimensions for machine learning models.

#### 5. Edge Detection
- Canny Edge Detection algorithm was applied.
- Edges highlight anatomical structures such as bones and lesions.

#### 6. Noise Addition
- Gaussian noise was artificially added to simulate real-world sensor noise.

#### 7. Noise Removal
- Gaussian Blur filter was applied to reduce noise while preserving structure.

## 🏥 Part 2: Medical Imaging Dataset Exploration

### Dataset 1: Chest X-ray Dataset (NIH)

#### 📌 Source
Provided by **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}**

#### 📊 Basic Information
- **Type:** Chest X-ray (Radiography)
- **Images:** ~112,000
- **Patients:** ~30,000
- **Labels:** 14 disease categories  
  (Pneumonia, Cardiomegaly, Edema, Fibrosis, etc.)

#### ⚖️ Dataset Imbalance
- Highly imbalanced dataset
- “No Finding” class dominates
- Rare diseases have very few samples

#### ⚠️ Challenges
- Weak labels (auto-extracted from reports)
- Multi-label overlap
- Varying image quality
- High noise in lung regions

#### 📝 Summary
This dataset is well-suited for **multi-label classification**, but requires:
- Class balancing techniques
- Robust preprocessing
- Careful evaluation metrics (AUROC, F1-score)

### Dataset 2: Skin Cancer Dataset (HAM10000)

#### 📌 Source
Available on **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}**

#### 📊 Basic Information
- **Type:** Dermoscopic skin lesion images
- **Images:** ~10,000
- **Classes:** 7  
  (Melanoma, Nevus, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratosis, etc.)

#### ⚖️ Dataset Imbalance
- Benign nevus class dominates
- Melanoma samples are significantly fewer

#### ⚠️ Challenges
- High visual similarity between classes
- Skin tone and lighting variation
- Small lesion sizes
- Annotation uncertainty

#### 📝 Summary
This dataset is widely used for **skin cancer detection**, but requires:
- Data augmentation
- Color normalization
- Advanced CNN models (ResNet, EfficientNet)
